1. Navigate to the Lambda function 'ValidateCustomer' in the AWS Lambda console

2. Select the 'Code' tab for the function

3. Review the function code, focusing on the first line where the error occurs

4. Replace any `require()` statements with the equivalent ES module `import` syntax. For example:
   - Change `const aws = require('aws-sdk');` to `import aws from 'aws-sdk';`
   - For named exports, use `import { namedExport } from 'module-name';`

5. If the file extension is '.js', change it to '.mjs' to indicate it's using ES module syntax

6. In the function configuration, ensure the 'Runtime' is set to 'Node.js 18.x' or later, which supports ES modules

7. If using environment variables or other configurations that were previously accessed via `process.env`, you may need to explicitly import them:
   ```javascript
   import { env } from 'process';
   ```

8. Save the changes to the function code

9. Deploy the updated function by clicking the 'Deploy' button

10. Test the function again to verify the error has been resolved
