# EDS (Extra-Dimensional Security) Call Center Design Specification

## **Overview**
The EDS call center provides specialized support for extra-dimensional security services, including handling Extra-Dimensional Incursions (EDIs), troubleshooting malfunctioning equipment, managing warranty replacements, and supporting product sales. This system will be built on Amazon Connect, integrated with AWS services for automation, scalability, and data management.

---

## **Key Features**

### **1. Interactive Voice Response (IVR) System**
The IVR system will be powered by Amazon Lex and will allow customers to:
- Report EDIs or request incident support.
- Schedule or run EDI drills (restricted to once every six weeks).
- Troubleshoot malfunctioning equipment.
- Request warranty replacements for faulty equipment.
- Order supplies or purchase additional products.
- Manage account and billing concerns.

#### **IVR Menu Options**
1. **Report an EDI (Breach)**
2. **Troubleshoot Equipment**
3. **Order Supplies or Equipment**
4. **Account and Billing Assistance**
5. **Run an EDI Drill**
6. **Request Equipment Replacement**
0. **Emergency Escalation**

### **2. Feature Details**

#### **A. EDI Management**
- **Reporting EDIs**:
  - Collect details: breach type, location, timestamp, containment status.
  - Route to Tier 1 or Tier 2 support based on severity.
  - Automatically log incidents in DynamoDB for tracking and future analysis.

- **Emergency Escalation**:
  - Critical breaches bypass IVR and connect directly to Incident Response Team.
  - Auto-generate response plans using Lambda and notify field agents via SNS.

#### **B. EDI Drills**
- **Purpose**:
  - Allow clients to simulate EDIs to test their response systems and protocols.

- **Workflow**:
  - Check eligibility (ensure six weeks have passed since the last drill).
  - Schedule or execute drills using predefined scenarios.
  - Notify stakeholders via SNS.
  - Log drill results in DynamoDB and store detailed reports in S3.

#### **C. Equipment Troubleshooting**
- **IVR Dialogue**:
  - Example: “What is the issue with your control box? Say 'error code' or describe the problem.”

- **Backend Workflow**:
  - Lex collects details and triggers a Lambda function for diagnostics.
  - Query DynamoDB for troubleshooting guides or IoT device logs.
  - Escalate unresolved issues to Tier 2 agents.

#### **D. Warranty Replacements**
- **Process**:
  - Collect product details: serial number, issue description.
  - Check warranty status in DynamoDB.
  - If under warranty:
    - Confirm replacement and trigger shipping workflow.
    - Notify the client via SMS or email.
  - If not under warranty:
    - Route to the sales department.

#### **E. Supplies and Sales**
- **Product Catalog**:
  - Stored in DynamoDB, including pricing, availability, and descriptions.

- **Sales Workflow**:
  - Lex assists clients in locating products and placing orders.
  - Cross-sell and upsell based on purchase history (e.g., “Customers who bought Mirror Fabric also purchased Reflectatine Adhesive.”).
  - Use Lambda to generate invoices and trigger fulfillment workflows.

#### **F. Account and Billing Assistance**
- **Common Issues**:
  - View and pay invoices.
  - Update subscription tiers.
  - Resolve billing disputes.

- **Automation**:
  - Lex retrieves and updates account details in DynamoDB.
  - Route complex issues to human agents.

### **3. Backend Architecture**

#### **AWS Services**
- **Amazon Connect**: Core call center platform.
- **Amazon Lex**: Power the IVR system for natural language understanding.
- **AWS Lambda**: Execute custom business logic.
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Store customer data, product catalog, incident logs, and warranty records.
- **Amazon S3**: Store call recordings, reports, and documentation.
- **Amazon SNS**: Send notifications to clients and stakeholders.
- **Amazon Polly**: Provide text-to-speech for IVR interactions.
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitor call center performance and trigger alarms.
- **Amazon QuickSight**: Visualize call center KPIs and trends.

#### **Data Model (DynamoDB)**
- **Customers**:
  - CustomerID (Primary Key)
  - Name
  - Contact Information
  - Subscription Tier

- **Products**:
  - ProductID (Primary Key)
  - Name
  - Description
  - Price
  - Stock

- **Incidents**:
  - IncidentID (Primary Key)
  - CustomerID (Foreign Key)
  - Breach Details
  - Timestamp
  - Severity
  - Status

- **Drills**:
  - DrillID (Primary Key)
  - CustomerID (Foreign Key)
  - Timestamp
  - Results

### **4. Monitoring and Analytics**
- **Contact Lens for Amazon Connect**:
  - Perform sentiment analysis to identify customer satisfaction levels.
  - Generate insights into frequently reported issues.

- **Amazon QuickSight Dashboards**:
  - Metrics: Average handling time, first-call resolution rate, EDI incident frequency, drill performance.

- **Amazon CloudWatch Alarms**:
  - Alerts for unprocessed calls, high call volumes, or SLA breaches.

---

### **5. Scalability and Disaster Recovery**
- **Auto Scaling**:
  - Lambda functions and DynamoDB tables automatically scale based on demand.
- **Redundancy**:
  - Use multi-region deployment for critical data.
- **Backup**:
  - Regular backups of DynamoDB and S3.

---

### **6. Security Measures**
- **Authentication**:
  - Use Amazon Cognito for secure user authentication.
- **Data Encryption**:
  - Encrypt data in transit (TLS) and at rest (KMS).
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - Restrict access to sensitive systems and data.

---

### **7. Example Workflow: Reporting an EDI**
1. **Client Call**: Customer dials in and selects "Report an EDI."
2. **Lex Dialogue**:
   - "Please describe the breach type. For example, say 'portal instability' or 'entity incursion.'"
3. **Data Capture**:
   - Breach details logged in DynamoDB.
4. **Routing**:
   - Route to Tier 1 for containment advice or Tier 2 for escalation.
5. **Resolution**:
   - Incident Response Team notified via SNS.
   - Follow-up report generated and stored in S3.
